# Cozytouch
This is an Atlantic Cozytouch cloud integration. Atlantic use multiple protocols, in my case the protocol is different than the one implemented by official integration (overkiz).

This has been tested using on : 
  - `Atlantic Naema 2 Micro 25` gas boiler using a `Ǹavilink Radio-Connect 128` thermostat
  - `Atlantic Naema 2 Duo 25` gas boiler using a `Ǹavilink Radio-Connect 128` thermostat
  - `Atlantic Naia 2 Micro 25` gas boiler using a `Ǹavilink Radio-Connect 128` thermostat
  - `Atlantic Loria Duo 6006 R32` heat pump using a `Navilink Radio-Connect 128` thermostat
  - `Takao M3` air conditionning
  - `Kelud 1750W` towel rack

A special mapping needs to be done for each model type, feel free to create an issue to help supporting your device.
